# Tournament Results 

## Project 4 Overview

![](http://progressed.io/bar/40?title=Progress)

The objective of this project was to create a database of a tournamnet using the SWISS-Paring system for pairing up players in each round, whereas players are not eliminated, and each player is paired with another player with the same number of wins as possible. 

For more information on the Swiss-Pairing system [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)

 The project consisted of two parts: defining the database schema(SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it in tournament.py using Python.
